# Neftify web components

Neftify's web components library is an evolving set of high-quality elements to accelerate the adoption of web3 technologies.

This library combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a single library with lazy-loading, and 100% standards web Components to run in any browser. This means they work in any major framework or no framework at all.

## Requirements

+ NodeJS >= v16.14.0 ([NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) is highly recommended - check `.nvmrc` file)

+ NPM (minimum version 8)

+ [Local dev](https://localwp.com/)

## Getting Started

From the root of this repository, run:

```bash
yarn serve:wc # runs the web components local development environment
```

To build the components, run:

```bash
yarn build:wc
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
yarn test:wc
```

## Using the components

There are three strategies we recommend for using web components built with Stencil.

The first step for all three of these strategies is to [publish to NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

### Script tag

  + + Put a script tag similar to this `<script type='module' src='https://unpkg.com/@neftify/connect/@0.0.1/dist/neftify.esm.js'></script>` in the head of your index.html
+ Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc

### Node Modules

+ Run `npm install @neftify/connect --save`
+ Put a script tag similar to this `<script type='module' src='node_modules/neftify/dist/neftify.esm.js'></script>` in the head of your index.html
+ Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc

### In any javascript framework

+ Run `npm install @neftify/connect --save`
+ Add an import to the npm packages `import neftify;`
+ Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc
